== Welcome to the 5C Book Exchange!

This is a web app i created to simplify the process of buying and selling textbooks for 5C students. Why did I make this app, when there are so many different services (Chirps, Huntley, SwoopThat, Ebay, Amazon) that we can use to buy and sell books? Because at the end of the day, I've never been satisfied with these methods and usually end up feeling ripped off. Why is the 5C-Book Exchange any better?

  - No shipping:
    Your books are rarely more than a mile from your dorm. This means no shipping costs, and no wait. You search for a book, and have it within hours, if not minutes. And since you get to meet the seller in person, you can be sure of the condition of the book before making any commitment to purchase.

  - No extra fees:
    When you buy or sell a book on Amazon or Ebay, even if it's used, the middleman gets a cut of the money. Why do we even need the middleman?

  - Tailored to 5C students and their classes:
    Every year, the exact same classes are offered on the 5Cs, over and over. And unless a major revision is released, the same textbook is often used for a number of years. So why do we even need an outside source for the majority of our textbooks?

  - Simple to use:
    To sell a book, all you need is a 5C email address. To buy a book, you don't even need to sign up! The 5C Book Exchange is dedicated to a single task, so I'm able to focus on doing it right. There isn't a lot you can do with this site, which makes it incredibly simple to use. The hassle of just setting up a seller account on ebay is enough for many students to return their books to Huntley at a considerable loss.


TODO list:


Before merge to master and push to 5CBookExchange.com:
	- Update user facebook info each time they login
	- Make facebook redirection consistent in the session
	- Set up basic network structure:
		- Ensure there is a proper error page if a user has no facebook schools
		- Restrict search to current user network
		- If not signed in, allow users to choose what college to look at (original landing page with searchbar)! Once they sign up, they are locked into their Facebook schools.
		
Later:
	- Refactor out transactions for much faster request processing
	


For future:
Try postgres 9.1 shared!
Implement fun features in 5CBE
  - Add email for when a book doesnt match (to me)
Send email to users asking for feedback



BUG LIST:
when a book exists but is unavailable, searching for it will display an empty table.
Should listing id be attr_accessible?
search by prof, course number/department could be much improved with substrings)
