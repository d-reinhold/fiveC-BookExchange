<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>How can I make sure my book is shown when other students search for their classes?</p>
 <br>
 <p class="about">There are two ways:</p>

  - No extra fees:<br>
    <p class="about">When you buy or sell a book on Amazon or Ebay, even if it's used, the middleman gets a cut of the money. Why do we even need a middleman?</p>

  - Tailored to 5C students and their classes:<br>
    <p class="about">Every year, the exact same classes are offered on the 5Cs, over and over. And unless a major revision is released, the same textbook is often used for a number of years. We simply don't need an outside source for the majority of our textbooks.</p>

  - Integrated course search feature:<br>
    <p class="about">Just type in your classes, and instantly you'll find out if there are any books you need to buy, which books, and if any 5C students are trying to sell those books. All in one place! (Note that since this site is very new, there may not be a lot of books posted right away. Check back in a few days and there will undoubtedly be many more!</p>

  - Simple to use:<br>
    <p class="about">To sell a book, all you need is a 5C email address. To buy a book, you don't even need to sign up! The 5C Book Exchange is dedicated to a single task, and it does it right. There isn't a lot to do on the site, which makes it incredibly simple to use. The hassle of just setting up a seller account on Ebay is enough for many students to return their books to Huntley at a considerable loss.</p>
