<%= @buyer_name %>, you requested a book on the 5C Book Exchange!
You requested <%=@transaction.listing.title%> from <%=@seller.name%> for $<%=@transaction.listing.price_dollars%>.<%=@transaction.listing.price_cents%>! We sent an email to <%=@seller.name.split(' ')[0]%> notifying him/her, and you can expect an email from <%=@seller.name.split(' ')[0]%> soon!
